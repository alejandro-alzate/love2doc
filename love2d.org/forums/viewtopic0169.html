				<div class="content">Hello everyone!<br>
<br>
Packaging and distribution can be a big hassle for LÖVE, which is why great tools like love-release and other packagers exist. However, installing these can be tricky and error prone. I've experienced a number of dependency issues with love-release (libzip, luarocks, etc.) and it has led to a lot of frustration. I just wanted a tool that was easy to install, easy to use, and can build my game quickly and without any trouble.<br>
<br>
So, I created a tool called boon: <a href="https://github.com/camchenry/boon" class="postlink">https://github.com/camchenry/boon</a><br>
<br>
boon is a build tool for LÖVE. It makes it easy to package your game for multiple platforms, similar to love-release. It is a single executable with no other dependencies. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can be used across multiple projects and makes automated building a breeze.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Features</span>
<ul>
<li>Package your game for multiple platforms. Supported platforms: <ul>
<li> Native (.love)</li>
<li> Windows (.exe)</li>
<li> macOS (.app)</li>
<li>Linux (coming soon)</li>
</ul></li>
<li> Package your game for multiple versions of LÖVE. Supported versions: <ul>
<li> 11.1x</li>
<li> 0.10.2</li>
</ul></li>
<li> No external dependencies</li>
<li> Deploy to multiple destinations (coming soon)</li>
</ul>

You can download the latest release here: <a href="https://github.com/camchenry/boon/releases" class="postlink">https://github.com/camchenry/boon/releases</a><br>
<br>
Basic instructions for getting started are in the README: <a href="https://github.com/camchenry/boon/blob/master/README.md" class="postlink">https://github.com/camchenry/boon/blob/master/README.md</a><br>
<br>
This is an early release so there is guaranteed to be bugs, so let me know what issues you come across and I would be glad to help resolve them.</div>

Hi, thank you for the report. Would you mind opening an issue on GitHub so I can keep track of this? It would also greatly help me if you could include screenshots of the problem. I do not currently have access to a macOS device. I will look into this as soon as I get a chance.</div>

				<div class="content">Please pardon the double post, but I wanted to announce the next version of boon, 0.2.0, which can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/camchenry/boon/releases/tag/0.2.0" class="postlink">https://github.com/camchenry/boon/releases/tag/0.2.0</a>.<br>
<br>
This was a primarily bug-fixing and clean-up release, but there are still some good changes. Here's what's changed:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Added</span>
<ul>
<li> New build report to show output file name, elapsed time, and total output size.<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1514176/76713798-9c191200-66f9-11ea-9e80-8f38fbcdcda8.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Changed</span>
<ul>
<li> Error handling to better highlight what caused an error to occur. An error will now display a list of causes, in order. <ul>
    <li> Before: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1514176/76713893-35e0bf00-66fa-11ea-8cbf-8cb8da2d42ce.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></li>
    <li> After: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1514176/76713895-3f6a2700-66fa-11ea-81a7-3c18d576d6da.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></li>
</ul></li>
<li> "boon build" learned how to build all supported targets at the same time using the --target all option.</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Fixed</span>
<ul>
<li> "boon love download" no longer makes an extra unnecessary HTTP request when downloading LÖVE which should improve performance.</li>
<li> "boon --version" now displays the correct release version.</li>
<li> Unnecessary references (pointers) to small integers values have been removed, slightly improving performance.</li>
<li> Library dependencies have been updated, improving performance and fixing many issues.</li>
<li> Duplicate entries in the ignore list when merging default and project configuration, removing unneeded work on build.</li>
<li> Copy semantics for platform/bitness enums, which may have resolved some issues with cross-platform compatibility.</li>
</ul>

I would also like to note that the issue which pauljessup was experiencing is now fixed, thanks to their help.</div>

Quick suggestion, Ikroth - update the OP here and the GitHub README.md to indicate that Linux <em class="text-italics">is</em> now supported.  And Love 11.3 too.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/ms-wink.png" width="16" height="16" alt=";)" title="Wink">
</div></blockquote>

I believe that the description is still accurate. boon supports Linux in the sense that there is a binary of boon itself that can run on 64 bit architectures, however there is no native Linux build target for games. The only way to "build for Linux" is creating a love file and asking users to install LOVE on their own machine. Of course, native Linux build would be a genuine executable, but that suffers from portability issues. So, I would consider boon to support Linux builds when it can create something like an AppImage or a Snap. I would like to make that possible, but it is a large task and I do not have the time at the moment to do it.<br>
<br>
As far as supporting 11.3 goes, I believe I have updated all of the references for this release, but if I missed any, please let me know.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your comments.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm using a Makefile for make my builds (also TravisCI to test and build), so I don't get the point of a build tool.
