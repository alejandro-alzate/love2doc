Hi everyone. I'm a new Love2d developer who is slowly learning how to use this great framework. I just wanted to add to this conversation that the newest hot Steam and Switch game Balatro was also developed in Love2D and was ported to Switch as well. Just a data point to add to this conversation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=268304">jasohill</a> — Thu Mar 07, 2024 5:41 am</p><hr />

Of course I was not expecting a free port I would not even trust any free port really. I get that source would be provided but if I did understand the port, I could just make the port myself. So I would consider ports only if coming from registered businesses, developers through official channels, getting a bill for the port would actually be the best option I would consider.<br><br>The project I am working on is not ready to be published yet, but for the first time I got very interested in targeting the Switch more so than an iPad or Android tablet.

Keep in mind that even if you have a game that you'd like to port to Switch (or other consoles), the people who have existing ports do not necessarily offer those ports for free. Some of them are running a business of porting love2d games to Switch (offering to port and publish games for a revenue split), or might like to have some compensation for offering their porting work to you (the deal you arrive to may vary). You might be able to get some tips or pointers on how to do the love2d port yourself, but for this you'd need to have signed the necessary NDAs with Nintendo.<br><br>However, as usual, the important thing to have first and foremost is a game to port. No use worrying about ports until that's covered.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138465">MrFariator</a> — Sat Dec 30, 2023 10:50 pm</p><hr />

There are multiple unofficial Switch ports that use Nintendo's actual SDK rather than a homebrew route. Once you've signed Nintendo's NDAs you can probably contact the authors of those ports. They can't be publicly available to people who haven't signed those NDAs because they're using the official NDA'd SDK.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1399">slime</a> — Sat Dec 30, 2023 6:30 pm</p><hr />

Hi guys!<br><br>I was just wondering what is the probability of an official Nintendo Switch port?<br><br>I heard there are unofficial homebrew ports which indicate it is possible but the trouble is as far as I know, once you ever sign the NDA and become an official Nintendo Developer at any point in your life, Nintendo can actually sue you for touching homebrew staff. It is actually included in their NDA once you sign it, you are not allowed to get involved with the homebrew community in any capacity.<br><br>So do you guys think there would ever be an official Nintendo Switch port available?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=177312">ddabrahim</a> — Sat Dec 30, 2023 6:15 pm</p><hr />

I've been working on developing a JRPG for a little while in my free time (very cliche, I know, but it's fun mental work) and the guy I get music from happened to see a "sound test" menu I made and asked if it were at all possible for me to snip that section out and allow him to use it as an online music player for people to sample his music from. Remembering Love.js was a thing, I told him I probably could.<br><br>All-in-all, I've got the thing more-or-less working, however, we've encountered a strange issue where the song doesn't change if the player is not the active tab in the browser (or not the active window if there are more than one instances of the browser open). He also claims that if you stay away long enough, the graphics stop updating and the GUI timers I have need to play catch up when you navigate back to it.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is related to clipped autoplay functionalities we used to have in the earlier days of the net, or if it's something else. I've made a copy for myself to test on itch.io you can check out <a href="https://hikitsune-red.itch.io/mptest?secret=VSQb4XGGw37nSVuBrlAIduNUfE" class="postlink">here</a>, and I've attached a .love below that is free of the issue itself, so I know it's Love.js related (though, my code is messy, I'm not gonna lie, and I'm sure there are more than a few stragglers from things I was testing at the time I copied my code, or just plain things from my game straight-up—you've been warned  <img class="smilies" src="https://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-crazy.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":crazy:" title="Hurr Durr">  ).<br><br>Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!<dl class="file"><dt><img src="./images/upload_icons/love.png" alt="" /> <a class="postlink" href="https://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=23762">ProjectSirena_mini.love</a></dt></dl><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138981">Hikitsune-Red</a> — Sat Nov 18, 2023 2:51 pm</p><hr />

Hello,<br><br>The error message you're seeing is from Emscripten, the tool that is used to compile Love2D (and many other things) to JavaScript so it can run in a web browser. What it's saying is that you're trying to set up a new game loop while an old one is still running.<br><br>When you refresh the page, your browser tries to clean up everything from the previous page load, but it looks like the game loop from Love2D isn't being cleaned up properly. This could be because of some issue in love.js or it could be something specific to your game code.<br><br>One thing you could try is to manually stop the game loop before refreshing the page. You could do this with some JavaScript code that listens for the beforeunload event, which is fired just before the page is unloaded. Here's a simple example:<br><div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function() {  // This is where you would add code to stop the game loop  // The exact code depends on how your game loop is implemented});</code></pre></div>You would need to replace the comment with code that actually stops the game loop. The exact code would depend on how your game loop is implemented. It might involve calling a function like <strong class="text-strong">love.event.quit()</strong> or setting a variable that your game loop checks to see if it should continue running.<br><br>If you're not sure how to stop the game loop, you might want to ask for help on the Love2D forums or on a site like Stack Overflow. Be sure to include more information about how your game loop is set up and what you've tried so far.<br><br>Hope this helps!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=257598">josephpayne</a> — Tue Nov 14, 2023 9:05 am</p><hr />

In the love.graphics.draw() function, (self.orientation == 'top' and self.y + PIPE_HEIGHT or self.y) is not returning true or false, but rather it's using Lua's version of a ternary operation.<br><br>This can be read as: If self.orientation equals 'top', then use self.y + PIPE_HEIGHT, else use self.y.

Previous posts in this thread talk about at least one of those ports.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1399">slime</a> — Tue Sep 19, 2023 7:36 pm</p><hr />

I mean it would be perfect world where corporations (or anyone) could do this "you own nothing" shit, but this won't happens in near future.<br>Also, same principle applies not only to nintendo, but also Sony and Microsoft. For both XBOX and PlayStation you also need dev kit, which you can use and get only after signing NDA and paying fees of some sort of "dev account".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=169762">GVovkiv</a> — Tue Sep 19, 2023 7:27 pm</p><hr />
