Hello!<br><br>I was looking through the internet about how to use soundfonts (in .sf2 format) to play MIDI files, what can greatly reduce the size of the project and add a special charm to the game since it doesn't need to rely on the OS soundbank (that in case of Windows is very terrible).<br><br>I don't know if Löve natively supports it, but i saw in the wiki something about loading C/C++ libraries (or .dll/.so) and looking through Github i saw two libraries for that: <a href="https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont" class="postlink">TinySoundFont</a>, that is pretty raw since the dev need to implement all the .mid loading to pass each note through the library to be processed, if i'm not mistaken, and <a href="https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth" class="postlink">FluidSynth</a>, i already knew about this library since mkxp used it internally, seems to be more easy to play midis through it.<br><br>I don't have much knowledge about working with C/C++ libraries or interacting with DLL/SOs, so does anybody here tried to work with libs like these to play mids in a pretty way using Löve?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=139626">vico</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 3:37 pm</p><hr />

Bit late to the party on this one, but I was wondering how to create an APK as well, and this is the first thread I found on the subject. I'm only just learning Lua, and the instructions in the wiki for game distribution appear to presume some prior knowledge for generating android apps. APKTool seems to be a bit depreciated for the current version of Love2d. Any clarification, or more up to date/newbie-friendly instructions would be greatly appreciated. And if not...well...generating .love files for testing is pretty straight forward anyway. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read/reply to this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=212438">zingo</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 8:39 am</p><hr />

Hi Vico, I'm currently writing a JRPG engine using love2d as the game engine and Java (swing framework) as the editor. The project is going on well: i'd say the editor is almost complete while the engine is at 70% or so (vehicles and battle system are still missing although i've already done the latter in another project you can find on this forum).<br><br>If it can help i started by writing the engine BEFORE coding the editor just because things like the map format or database entries can change (and they will) during the process. I've chosen Java because i'm using it at work, but the gui library is old and crappy so, if i were you, i'd try something else (like Electron maybe or some other modern web-based framework).<br><br>Since i'm working full time and in my spare time i'm going on with my own engine, i fear that i wouldn't be able to contribute with your project but feel free to ask for help and suggestions.<br><br>Another tip: you will feel discouraged at some point because the project is big. Just don't drop it<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=147656">Tabaqui</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 8:14 am</p><hr />

I'm new here...as well as rather new to coding in general, but I think that an "RPG editor" is a great idea! I've been working through various tutorials/examples, and for me, an "object oriented" or "modular" approach for the many different components of an RPG, (or any kind of game, really), (such as sound, input, physics, events, states, ai, text/dialogue, inventory, serializing data, particles, shaders, etc.) has been the easiest to understand and organize. I've used RPGmaker in the past, and while I found it to be a great tool for "storyboarding" or "prototyping" an idea, coding something of my own from scratch, or building on what others have provided, has given me much more flexibility and insight.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=212438">zingo</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 8:08 am</p><hr />

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Easyrpgs objective was to make old games playable on non closed platforms. <br>Everyone gaming on an RPI is very grateful for that effort. <br><br>Thing to consider: RPGmaker was a thing that was used BECAUSE it had limitations. <br>Once you give it the  ability to eat plugins and scripts it loses its reason of existing. <br>Or in other words: If i want to do code i want to do so without having anyones mediocre middleman wrapped around BUT if i dont want to code, like in rpgmaker, i dont want to see it anywhere and want it to work fully without.</div></blockquote>i respectfully disagree what you reasoning. One of the reasons i would go with an RPG Editor instead of a pure engine like Love is because i dont need to scour through and code from scratch lots and lots of complicated modules (battle system, tileset, EXP, XP, Magic, Techs, Items/Inventories), since all those parts are already stabilished the user can focus more in the artistic aspect of the game (both story-wise and audiovisual).<br><br>The purpose of plugins in my vision is just to complement one or other aspect of the basic project, not really a full rewrite (that would be a mod) of that aspect. That would server more as a pontual change for the specific project.<br><br>Coding an JRPG from scratch on Love (or any other similar framework) would be too much hurdle for a newbie/non-coding user, and that's precisely why i want to try to make a low-code tool in first place.
