Thank you for the kinda words and feedback! recovery is slow but steady, and I fully intend to keep powering through on this (albeit at a very relaxed pace until I'm better).<br><br>For more context on those map skills (hopefully I'm not repeating myself, I don't recall if I mentioned this here or not), they are intended as a simpler/more streamlined approach to Golden Sun's mechanic of casting spells out-of-combat to solve puzzles. I always loved the exploration and puzzle-solving aspects of those games, but didn't think that exact mechanic would fit as-is due to certain narrative and design aspects of the game... so instead I'm tying it to the characters themselves, and the kinds of abilities/knowledge/etc they might bring with them on the adventure. <br><br>That same mechanical 'theme' is also present in how the game's job system functions, but we'll get there later. Gotta keep some surprises for later after all!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 5:26 pm</p><hr />

I really hope you are able to continue work on this and that your health has improved. It looks fantastic so far! I especially like the idea of "Map Skills" as it makes the world more interesting and immersive. I grew up playing early "top down" console RPGs, so random combat is fine, (although I really like how Chrono Trigger had scripted "ambush" style encounters, because the player could avoid them if they just wanted to get on with the narrative, or 7th Saga, where you had a sort of "radar" crystal ball). As for saving...I'd suggest "autosave" as the player exits the game, and classic "save points" in "safe areas". Looking forward to future progress for this project, hang in there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=212438">zingo</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 9:18 am</p><hr />

I would like to implement a menu later, I would like to get mechanics of the game working first like the movement you just mentioned.

It is better to attach the .love file so user on all systems can run it.<br>I am bad at jumping games that require pixel perfect movement so I was too lazy to run it with Wine or repack it.

Hello all!<br><br>This is my first time making a game and the project I have in mind is far bigger. But I would like to share a simple demo of what I have created. Obviously it's not perfect but I would like to get some honest criticisms. If you think it sucks or if you think it's amazing (which I would be definitely be more surprised if I saw more of the later) then it could really help put me on track to make sure my vision comes true. I hope you enjoy this short two player experience and maybe I can have a full game out soon!<br><br>itch link<br><br><a href="https://snobbz.itch.io/soccer-tennisdemo" class="postlink">https://snobbz.itch.io/soccer-tennisdemo</a><dl class="file"><dt><img src="./images/upload_icons/love.png" alt="" /> <a class="postlink" href="http://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=21934">Soccer Tennis.love</a></dt></dl><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=208776">MaxGamz</a> — Fri Jan 06, 2023 7:01 pm</p><hr />
