<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...</div></blockquote>&gt; Could it be that Löve is not the best choice of langage for what I'm trying to do?<br>People might say it's geared towards games, and that's not wrong, but it's still possible to do most things with it... i mean, others have also made tools with it, some made soft synths as well; i'm also working on some stuff, including a more or less complete composing software, so it's definitely possible.<br><br>&gt; That's where I'm hoping Peter Billam's set of MIDI lua libraries might come in handy<br>It could be a possibility, although the one i saw on that page does offline conversion, not realtime... it might still be fine for your use case though, if it can be either used through löve, or called as an external application.<br><br>&gt; later in your reply, you said you "tried to" write one? You gave up?<br>I put it on hold, since i couldn't figure out why it was parsing some things wrong... not a good idea for me to suffer through that kind of annoyance for too long.<br><br>&gt;That sounds like a nice idea <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-smile.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":)" title="Smile"> How far along are you? A soft synth is what turns the midi info into audio, right? Are you going to write your own?<br>As i mentioned before, the midi file parser is on hold for now; and for synths, i have too many projects and random files with stuff i want to implement, it's hard to combine all of that into one thing. But yes, i'm writing my own things, with info from elsewhere of course; different synthesis types and waveforms and effects and whatnot.<br>Also, technically speaking, a synth just turns whatever data it supports, be it midi or otherwise, and makes audio from it, either to your speakers, or writing it directly to disk.<br><br>&gt;Hmmm... simply outputing a frequency will result in audio that won't sound very musical, will it?<br>You'll still hear the correct pitches, but yes, if everything is just a sine wave, it'll get annoying real fast; that's actually the problem with Löve's own handling of midi, if you don't have timidity... and i'd wager most people don't, hence one of my goals being to create a lua-side parser and synth (and sampler) library that could work cross-platform to play back midi with consistent instruments... at least if using the default General Midi ones. (although at that point, i could make my own format that combines the midi file with some instrument definitions as well, to make it more versatile, and still be portable... this probably already exists though, people just don't know/forgot about it, like pat files or such; most of this was DOS and Amiga era stuff anyway, which is considered ancient.)<br><br>&gt; And down the line, I'm hoping to add some chord recognition, that will take polyphonic support...<br>Technically, i should have said that i expected your input midi files to only use one channel / one instrument; polyphony within those constraints is possible and still relatively simple considering the program you want to write as a test.<br><br>&gt; Again that sounds like trying hard not to use an existing synth? Why would I want to do that?<br>Because none exists as far as i know, in the context of Löve applications / libraries... that said, i do recall 1 or 2, but i'm not sure if the people did write them with löve, or if they moved to something else. In any case, this one is really simple, and i'd recommend to do this. <em class="text-italics">(re: A simpler way to play sounds would be to have one sound file of one instrument, say a piano note or a guitar string being strung, then you could load that into löve and play it back with whatever pitch it needs to be.)</em><br><br>&gt; So if I understand you correctly, any virtual MIDI synth will handle those instruments (using a soundfont or not) and I don't really need to worry about using the soundfont, the synth will handle it if it needs it?<br>Nope, depends on the synth what sound it produces and whether it cares about midi instruments or not; even using a soundfont doesn't guarantee it'll have all sounds that the GM (general midi) standard defines... and even if it did, the quality can and will differ... you can check out some youtube vids that play the OST of transport tycoon deluxe through multiple midi-compatible devices to hear the difference (and yes, they all play back the same midi files)<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSEfKAYyNo" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSEfKAYyNo</a> using Windows GeneralMidi sounds.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTi6LG8aeK8" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTi6LG8aeK8</a> using the AdLib sound card (has a yamaha chip, midi instruments are purely synthesized)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol6Wv4bn2Lc" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol6Wv4bn2Lc</a> using the Gravis Ultrasound sound card (it plays back samples, sounding subjectively better)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2n1tIaMy5E" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2n1tIaMy5E</a> using a roland MT-32 hardware unit (hybrid synth+sampler, not GM compliant, instruments will sound different)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJu8u3QOmk" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJu8u3QOmk</a> using a roland SC-88 hardware unit (hybrid synth+sampler, but people mostly used the high-quality samples instead of the cut-down synthesizer it had)<br><br>&gt; I'm curious, why did you choose not to use MIDI then?<br>A few reasons; midi is more limited in terms of how much control you have over the individual voices compared to a tracker module; also, the format was simpler to implement compared to midi, and it also comes with its own sound files, meaning less work since i didn't need to write a synth for that. <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-three.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":3" title="Awww"><br><br><br>...btw, if it was up to me, i'd not use anything related to web or whatever that would need a browser to run, that feels cheap to me and i'm averse to have whatever browser i have running for a local tool...  <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-surprised2.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":o:" title="Oh"><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80325">zorg</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 3:32 pm</p><hr />

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hi and welcome to the forums.<br><br>I have to break it to you, that's not simple.</div></blockquote>Yes, I appreciate that now... oh my! Sounds like this little project might keep me busy for a while  <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-huh.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":huh:" title="Huuh..."> <br>Thanks for taking the time to write such an extensive response  <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-smile.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>LÖVE doesn't have a standard way of handling MIDI devices, and that needs a per-OS implementation for any library wanting to implement such a thing. (<a href="https://github.com/SiENcE/lovemidi" class="postlink">https://github.com/SiENcE/lovemidi</a> exists, but i haven't tried to use it yet so i can't say whether that works decently or not...) </div></blockquote>I'll look into lovemidi, thanks for the link. Could it be that Löve is not the best choice of langage for what I'm trying to do?<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The docs/specs i found on MIDI liked to not explain that MIDI is both a file format and a transmission format, and some details only pertain to one or the other, but not both. </div></blockquote>That's a very interesting remark. Reading it was a little light bulb moment for me. You're right! I need to look into this further and understand the nuances better...  <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-monocle.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":monocle:" title="Monocle"> <br><br>So reading/parsing the midi file is one thing<br>Playing it is another<br>And handling input from a MIDI device is yet another thing<br><br>Hmmm... food for thought <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-smile.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br><br>Thanks for the insight.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>With löve, you can open a MIDI file, but it will be treated as an audio stream, like wav or mp3; you can't get the notes from it, and there's a high chance that it will be played back without any instruments whatsoever (due to löve using libmodplug to handle midi files, and that requires Timidity to exist on your system, on a specific path.) ...</div></blockquote>That's where I'm hoping Peter Billam's set of MIDI lua libraries might come in handy <a href="https://pjb.com.au/midi/" class="postlink">https://pjb.com.au/midi/</a> <br>Else I guess I will need to write my own MIDI parser... later in your reply, you said you "tried to" write one? You gave up?<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>i probably should fix my own midi reader library, add a soft synth to it, and release it as a library. </div></blockquote>That sounds like a nice idea <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-smile.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":)" title="Smile"> How far along are you? A soft synth is what turns the midi info into audio, right? Are you going to write your own?  <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Fluidsynth is a standalone software synthesizer that can use sf2 soundfonts to turn midi notation into audio; i have found like two lua libraries that wrap fluidsynth, but i'm not sure if those would work with löve or not; </div></blockquote>i'll have to look into that<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>technically it's not a requirement if you just want to deal with midi messages; one can write a simple synth that just outputs a specific frequency sine or square or whatever waveform without any libraries (this is something you can do with löve) so you can deal with non-polyphonic midi stuff this way too, if you don't want to mess around with external dependencies too much (except for the midi interface stuff for input, i mean)</div></blockquote>Hmmm... simply outputing a frequency will result in audio that won't sound very musical, will it?<br>Writing a virtual synth that will make a piano piece sound like an actual piano... feels way beyong my programming abilities...  And down the line, I'm hoping to add some chord recognition, that will take polyphonic support... so I'd rather find an appropriate open source virtual synth and use that. <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>A simpler way to play sounds would be to have one sound file of one instrument, say a piano note or a guitar string being strung, then you could load that into löve and play it back with whatever pitch it needs to be. (as long as the sound's own pitch is not too far from what the midi note is, it should not be too bad.)</div></blockquote>Again that sounds like trying hard not to use an existing synth? Why would I want to do that?<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>You don't need to use soundfonts; midi are just events, what you do with them is up to you; show a color, play a sound, vibrate your controller. <br>(...)<br>the currently used midi standard does define a set of 128 "instruments" in bank 0 (plus a few drumkits for midi channel 10) that people can assume should sound more or less how those instruments would sound... </div></blockquote> <br>So if I understand you correctly, any virtual MIDI synth will handle those instruments (using a soundfont or not) and I don't really need to worry about using the soundfont, the synth will handle it if it needs it? <br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I did write my own <a href="https://github.com/zorggn/LoveTracker" class="postlink">screamtracker3 replayer</a>, but that's not exactly midi... in some ways it's a simpler format, in other ways it's more complicated. </div></blockquote>I'm curious, why did you choose not to use MIDI then?<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Nope, i personally tried to write a midi parser using specs like this: <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/cmsip/readings/Standard-MIDI-file-format-updated.pdf" class="postlink">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/cmsip/rea ... pdated.pdf</a><br>And yes, it's not an easy read.<br><br>Good luck <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-three.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":3" title="Awww"></div></blockquote>Thanks, sounds like I will need some!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=212398">bruno.dumoulin</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2023 9:33 pm</p><hr />
