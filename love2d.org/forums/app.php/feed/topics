Hello!<br><br>I was looking through the internet about how to use soundfonts (in .sf2 format) to play MIDI files, what can greatly reduce the size of the project and add a special charm to the game since it doesn't need to rely on the OS soundbank (that in case of Windows is very terrible).<br><br>I don't know if Löve natively supports it, but i saw in the wiki something about loading C/C++ libraries (or .dll/.so) and looking through Github i saw two libraries for that: <a href="https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont" class="postlink">TinySoundFont</a>, that is pretty raw since the dev need to implement all the .mid loading to pass each note through the library to be processed, if i'm not mistaken, and <a href="https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth" class="postlink">FluidSynth</a>, i already knew about this library since mkxp used it internally, seems to be more easy to play midis through it.<br><br>I don't have much knowledge about working with C/C++ libraries or interacting with DLL/SOs, so does anybody here tried to work with libs like these to play mids in a pretty way using Löve?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=139626">vico</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 3:37 pm — Replies 2 — Views 58</p><hr />

Hello,<br><br>I'm an beginner musician who tinkers with code in his spare time and I would like to write a little video game to help me make progress in music. I'm a bit of a jack of all trades, I have a guitar, a keyboard and a dualo.<br><br>I would like to write a simple video game: the game plays a midi melody, I listen to it, and then I have to reproduce it, by ear, with my instrument.<br><br>At first, I would like to be able to play the game using my dualo connected as a MIDI keyboard. <br><br>The game plays a MIDI melody then pauses and waits for me to play the notes. Then I use my dualo to play the melody back to the game, and the game simply checks that I am playing the right notes in the right order, ignoring the rhythm.<br><br>In other words, if the midi file contains the melody for "frère jacques", the game simply checks that I am indeed playing "do re mi do, do re mi do, mi fa sol, mi fa sol..."<br><br>(Later on, I would like to be able to play it with my guitar or piano, but that means capturing audio, transforming the captured sounds into midi notes... and uh... for now, writing the code to play directly in midi is complicated enough for me!)<br><br>I have a little bit of experience in programming, but I'm a beginner in coding video games... and then MIDI is a strange beast... although it looks quite simple at first glance, but in fact i find it... a bit confusing. And the documentation I found is rather cryptic.<br><br>Here is precisely what I am trying to do<br><strong class="text-strong">Step 1:</strong> I just want to write the code that opens the midi file, plays it in audio, and gets the sequence of notes of the melody<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Step 2:</strong> write the code that plays the sound when I press a key on my dualo and compares my note sequence with the one from the file<br><br>In my mind, that sounded easy... and then...  well...<br><br>If I understand correctly, MIDI is only text information that describes sound events, but a MIDI file, in itself, does not include any sound. If the MIDI file contains an event 0x92 0x3D 0x78... , that means "note on", note 61 (meaning C# 4), velocity 78, right?<br><br>And my code must forward the event to some virtual synthetizer library that will synthesize sound, right?<br><br>Same thing if it's my dualo that sends the event, I guess? My kb will send a "note on" when I press a key, and a "note off" when I release the key?<br><br>From what I understand, to have sound, I need a virtual synthesizer, I guess it's a library?<br><br>In my research, I found fluidsynth.lua, a lua library that interfaces with fluidsynth Does this sound like a good idea? Should I keep digging there? Or do you have something better to recommend? It looks like the people at dualo are developping their new app around SurgeXT, would that be a good option for my game? If so, how can I make surgeXT calls from Lua/Löve2d? <br><br>A lot of things I find mention ALSA... but that stands for "Advanced Linux Sound Architecture", I guess that means it won't run on windows? <br><br>Then the sounds themselves are organized in a sound font, right?<br><br>The midi file also contains the info telling the synth which instrument to use, right? So, I would need to create some kind of mapping to say that this instrument corresponds to this sound font?<br><br>Has any of you ever coded musical games using MIDI? Can anyone here orient me to the appropriate libraries/tools?<br><br>Any pointers would be very appreciated. I bought the book "the midi manual" by David Miles Huber, but it's a difficult read... do you have other resources to recommend?<br><br>Thanks<br>Bruno<br><br>In case you're wondering, a dualo is a small synth that looks like that  (<a href="https://dualo.com/dualo/" class="postlink">https://dualo.com/dualo/</a>)<div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="http://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=21962" class="postimage" alt="dualo.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=212398">bruno.dumoulin</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2023 12:45 pm — Replies 9 — Views 225</p><hr />

Good day!  <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-three.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":3" title="Awww"> <br><br>I am trying to implement strict sprite appear ordering while keep them draw-order independent with the help of depth test. I watched some examples here and there, and wrote a simple playground for that, looks like it works, but I did it for the first time, and I need a review, did I get it right? Also I have a ton of small questions which I couldn't find on wiki or forum.<br><br>Here is expected result, brighter rings go on top of darker ones while they are drawn in random order:<div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="http://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=21959" class="postimage" alt="result.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div>Here is my example (just one main.lua file):<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>local canvas1local canvas2local imagelocal shaderlocal depthfunction love.load()    love.window.setMode(1700, 900, { resizable = false, vsync = true, borderless = false })    canvas1 = love.graphics.newCanvas(700, 700, { format = "rgba8" })    canvas2 = love.graphics.newCanvas(700, 700, { format = "rgba8" })    depth = love.graphics.newCanvas(700, 700, { format = "depth16" })    image = love.graphics.newImage(love.image.newImageData(100, 100))    shader = love.graphics.newShader([[        extern float z;        extern vec3 color;        void effect() {            float dist = distance(VaryingTexCoord.xy, vec2(0.5));            if (dist &gt; 0.5 || dist &lt; 0.3) discard;            gl_FragDepth = 1.0 - z;            love_Canvases[0] = vec4(vec3(z) * color.rgb, 1.0);            love_Canvases[1] = vec4(vec3(z) * color.bgr, 1.0);        }    ]])endfunction love.update(dt)    love.window.setTitle(love.timer.getFPS())    if love.keyboard.isDown("escape") then        love.event.quit()    endendfunction love.draw()    love.graphics.setCanvas({ canvas1, canvas2, depthstencil = depth })    love.graphics.clear({ 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0 }, { 0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0 })    love.graphics.setDepthMode("less", true)    love.math.setRandomSeed(0)    love.graphics.setShader(shader)    shader:send("color", { 1.0, 0.8, 0.6 })    for i = 1, 99 do        shader:send("z", love.math.random())        love.graphics.draw(image, love.math.random() * 600, love.math.random() * 600)    end    love.graphics.setCanvas()    love.graphics.setShader()    love.graphics.clear(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0)    love.graphics.draw(canvas1, 100, 100)    love.graphics.draw(canvas2, 900, 100)end</code></pre></div><ul><li>For code simplicity all numbers are hardcoded.</li><li>Actually I am trying to draw images, but here in order to keep all in one simple file I replaced .png with simple shader that just draw colored rings from dummy image with unimportant content.</li><li>I understand that with that approach I can handle only full transparent pixels, not half transparent.</li><li>My example draw to 2 canvases simultaneously, that is key feature that I need, so I tested it here as well. One draw call, two canvases, one depth buffer.</li><li>Often z-buffer / depth-buffer examples contain vertex shader, meshes, z-depth interpolation from vertices to fragments, etc. Which is common for 3d cases. I don't need that, because for each sprite I know exactly its depth value, and it is constant, so here I used only fragment shader.</li><li>I want separately created depth buffer, not default fullscreen buffer. Because that way I can change its dimentions as I want.</li></ul>So, the questions:<ol style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>Any advise? Did I done something wrong?</li><li>What about format of depth buffer? Here I used depth16 because I thought that it is enough for my purposes. But is it safe? Can there be a system that only supports depth24, or some other caveats?</li><li>Wiki says that except format there can be specified "readable", like { format="depth24", readable=true }. What is that?</li><li>In my example I clear 2 canvases with love.graphics.clear() correctly, but how to clear depth buffer also? I tried something like <div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>love.graphics.clear({ 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0 }, { 0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0 }, 0.5, 0.5)</code></pre></div> with no visible effect <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-cry.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"></li> <li>When setting draw target I use this:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>love.graphics.setCanvas({ canvas1, canvas2, depthstencil = depth })</code></pre></div>which looks correct by the wiki, but when I try that instead:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>love.graphics.setCanvas({ canvas1, canvas2, depth = depth })</code></pre></div>it also works <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-crazy.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":crazy:" title="Hurr Durr"> How? What is happening? Wiki says that name "depth" is supposed to be boolean. So, my depth buffer works like just "big true boolean value", and actually program uses another internal fullscreen depth buffer, or what? What format that buffer have? I never specified one...</li><li>In example I am using<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>love.graphics.setDepthMode("less", true)</code></pre></div>Looks like it works. But I can not get any results with different CompareMode, like "greater". Maybe because I failed to clear depth buffer with 1.0 instead of 0.0, maybe something else?</li></ol>Wiki links:<br><a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.setCanvas" class="postlink">https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.setCanvas</a><br><a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.setDepthMode" class="postlink">https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.setDepthMode</a><br><a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/CompareMode" class="postlink">https://love2d.org/wiki/CompareMode</a><br><a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/PixelFormat" class="postlink">https://love2d.org/wiki/PixelFormat</a><br><a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.clear" class="postlink">https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.clear</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=135618">Sasha264</a> — Fri Jan 13, 2023 4:01 pm — Replies 2 — Views 122</p><hr />
