Something like:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>function updateGraphRandomly(graph, dt, arg)local val = love.math.random()*argfpsGraph.updateGraph(graph, val, "Random: " .. math.floor(val*10)/10, dt)end</code></pre></div>Anyways, I'm gonna add more comments to the source code so others can understand it better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=63719">substitute541</a> — Thu Apr 03, 2014 1:31 am</p><hr />

Made out of my free time while taking a break from bigger projects.<br><br>A simple library that graphs <del>both FPS and Memory</del> any set of values you want to graph, including FPS and Memory. You can also have multiple graphs (used ordinary Lua tables instead of objects to make the lib smaller.)<br><br><a href="https://github.com/icrawler/FPSGraph" class="postlink">Github repo</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=63719">substitute541</a> — Wed Apr 02, 2014 1:22 am</p><hr />
