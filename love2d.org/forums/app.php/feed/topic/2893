The first for string syntax, the Ruby way.

I need your opinion guys. I want to add string interpolation, but I'd like some opinions on the style of how to do this. Firstly what syntax do you think is good. The two I have in mind is:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>"#{i * 42}. Say hello."</code></pre></div>(Ruby syntax), or<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>"$i * 42$. Say hello."</code></pre></div>(as seen in the reference manual). Being a Rubyist, I prefer the first out of those two of course.<br><br>Next is how to parse it. It'll need to be done by a method. My options here are:<br><br>1. When the call syntax is used with no arguments, it parse the string for interpolation.<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>("#{i * 42}. Say hello.")()</code></pre></div>2. A normal method, named run or something (suggestions on name?).<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>("#{i * 42}. Say hello."):run() -- or("#{i * 42}. Say hello."):parse()</code></pre></div>I tend to prefer the first, because it fits nicely with the syntax normally used with <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-loadstring">loadstring</a>:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>loadstring("foo = 3")()</code></pre></div>So what do you think?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1722">BlackBulletIV</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 10:51 am</p><hr />

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Do you know any good way to get yourself into TDD?</div></blockquote>The beaten path is the best one IMHO. Very succintly:<ul><li>Pick a small enough problem (strong is an excellent candidate)</li><li>(This is optional, but surprisingly useful) - write the README of the library. Make sure it includes some example, or the names of the methods you will use. Some people jokingly call this "README-driven development".</li> <li>Build up the "blank state" (so you are able to run the tests, even if there are no tests yet, without errors). In lua this usually means something like making a return {} on your main &lt;library&gt;.lua file, and making sure that you are able to require that file from inside the test_&lt;mylib&gt;.lua file (or spec_&lt;mylib&gt;.lua). As we have talked over email, I've found that in Lua the simplest solution for this is using symbolic links for the lib files/folders inside the tests folder.</li><li>Pick one method (or independent piece of functionality) for the lib. For example, the __index metamethod for strings.</li><li>Write a test for the simplest case of that method. For example, __index with a number only.</li><li>Make sure that the test fails. I mean, actually going to the console and making sure that the test fails properly - this makes sure that you have not, for example, made a syntax error on the test code.</li><li>Write just the minimum amount of code for making that test pass. This requires you to think like a programmer, not like a code monkey. For example, if your test does ("hello")[1], you don't have to make the index method return "h" on your test. You can actually skip the very very obvious steps and make it return self:sub(key, key)</li><li>Make sure that the test pass.</li><li>Add more tests, make them fail, implement them, and pass the tests again, until the functionality of that first method is complete (in the index case, numbers and not-numbers) and the edge cases have been discovered (what happens when a negative number is passed? what about nil? a function?)</li><li>Then move over to the next piece of functionality and start with the simplest case again.</li>  </ul>This might sound like a lot of work, but take into account that running the tests is super easy - In my case, it takes more time to save the file than to run the tests (because I use the mouse). You will discover soon enough that once you get into the flow, it's more satisfying than the "usual" way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=710">kikito</a> — Tue Apr 26, 2011 10:18 am</p><hr />

I'm not a TDD person by any means, I don't write tests much, but in this case I thought they were necessary for finding problems (and there's quite a few that have been found already). I find I have to force myself to write tests, I just find it boring. But maybe it would be different if I did tests first for the purpose of designing an API, I don't know.<br><br>I find the problem is, most of the time you write more test code than application code when using tests. So as an analogy, a builder places a brick down, which takes a minute. He then spends 5 minutes inspecting that he placed it correctly. So he ends up spending an hour laying bricks, and 5 hours checking that he didn't do anything wrong.<br><br>But anyway, I think I'm just put off by TDD because I've been doing it the exact opposite for some time now. Do you know any good way to get yourself into TDD? I guess this is same kind of ordeal I had with two-space indentation, I knew it was better (because I was coding in Ruby now), but I just couldn't get over not having four spaces; I ended up forcing myself to "get used to it", and now my eyes have adjusted and I can't stand using four spaces (except when I'm in a curly braced language, then I'm not sure what to do).<br><br>Anyway, enough rants from me.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">--------------------------------</strong><br><br>As for your post Robin, thanks heaps!

Your implementation of string.insert seems a bit... inefficient to me.<br><br>I'd do something like:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>function string:insert(index, other)  index = index % (#self+1)  if index == 1 then    return other .. self  elseif index == 0 then    return self .. other  else    return self:sub(1, index - 1) .. other .. self:sub(index)  endend</code></pre></div>Didn't test it, but it should work. It handles negative indices as well.<br><br>EDIT: position of insertion<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>---------------------| A | B | C | D | E |---------------------1   2   3   4   5   6-5 -4  -3  -2  -1   0</code></pre></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=436">Robin</a> — Tue Apr 26, 2011 8:40 am</p><hr />

I've been wanting some of the awesome features of <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html" class="postlink">Ruby's String class</a> for a little while now in Lua.
