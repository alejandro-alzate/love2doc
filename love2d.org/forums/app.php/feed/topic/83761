I am a beginner  in LÖVE development, English is not my first language and this is my first post in this forum... so HELLO!  <img class="smilies" src="https://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-awesome.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":awesome:" title="I'M SO HAPPY I COULD SHIT A RAINBOW RIGHT NOW"> <br><br>Well, I was designated with the task of implementing an AdMob banner ad in a game made with LÖVE, already ported to Android using the Martin Felis port, but the older version:<br><br><a href="https://bitbucket.org/MartinFelis/love-android-sdl2/overview" class="postlink">https://bitbucket.org/MartinFelis/love- ... 2/overview</a><br><br>I tried a lot of things, without success. Then I stumbled with a more recent forum topic, where Martin (master both) says that adding google play services library is not needed anymore. To show ads, is just necessary to call the functions he created, like "love.system.showBanner()". In this topic, he links to a new bitbucket url with, I think, a more recent version of the port:<br><br><a href="https://bitbucket.org/npinochet/love-android-sdl2/overview" class="postlink">https://bitbucket.org/npinochet/love-an ... 2/overview</a><br><br>Well... I tried a number of things to make this banner appear:<br>&gt;I tried adding google play lib in the older port, the one that already had the game that i need to implement the banner with;<br>&gt;I tried porting the game to the nem port, the one in the npinochet repository, that doesn't need the google play library, but the game couldn't generate a build<br>&gt;At last, i tried adding the library in this new port that doesn't require it, and it finally generated a build. BUT<br><br>The main error that i keep getting, the dead-end in all these alternatives I tried, is that the game doesn't recognize the new functions Martin created, createBanner() and showBanner().<br><br>The message error I get is the following:<br><br><img src="https://image.ibb.co/nCDqMF/ss.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br>In these last days I already learned about Ant apache, NDK, adding libraries without gradle or IDE and using adb debugger to track errors. But now i hit this dead end, and I don't know what to try anymore.<br><br>Any help? (I tried to PM Martin, but I couldn't)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=139043">phfranqueira</a> — Thu Mar 30, 2017 6:47 pm</p><hr />
