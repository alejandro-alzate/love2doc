<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also, why can't we use ladders? Is there a reason, or was it just not programmed in in time?</div></blockquote>This is the most widely mentioned issue by far. It is by design for two reasons. The first is technical: being my first time, and only having 48hrs, it seemed much easier to have the AI character pathfind and move on a simple grid. Using ladders meant the AI character didn't have to jump. The second reason was for gameplay: having the player and the AI character have different movemnt ability meant that some routes on the map are fast for the player and some routes are fast for the AI. This allows for a measure of strategy where the player must plan his or her path carefully, and choose a route based on the AI character's strengths and limitations. <br><br>Because the movement restrictions are not obvious it's confusing to players. I can certainly add info the the instruction screen to highlight this, but I also wonder if theres an in-game way to signal this as well. The other two gameplay mechanics: picking up coins and avoiding the girl bird have feedback mechanisms (+10 text and exploding hearts respectively). Any thoughts on how you would do this? Something other than ladders?<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Uh.... if you jump from the very top to the very bottom you go right through the floor. That's not supposed to happen. Your fall speed should be limited to less than 32 pixels per frame so that there's no way to fall more than one tile per frame.</div></blockquote>Thank you, that's very helpful.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>That game is awesome, I was fearing for my life when she started moving really fast</div></blockquote>Thanks for the compliment!<br><br>The game also has joystick support but I've only tested it with a 360 controller. I'm curious to know how it works for other people and other gamepads. I personally think it plays best with a controller as you get better control. Also, the walk cycle speed changes based on movement amount which I thought was a nice touch but most people never get to see using the keyboard.<br><br>Thanks everyone for the feedback. Its exciting for me to have created a game that other people found to be fun. Kinda been a dream of mine since I was a kid.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1766">GloryFish</a> — Wed Jan 12, 2011 4:21 am</p><hr />
