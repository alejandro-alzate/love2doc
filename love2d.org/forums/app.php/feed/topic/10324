just to let everyone know: i'll still work on finishing this, but based on some tests i've lost hope in it being very useful in many cases; it's not *as* slow as i figured it would be (clearing a canvas is really slow, though, but clearing it to full transparency can probably be sped up somewhat)... however, all those screenshots eat ram like popcorn, and you will get some hilariously high memory usage if you're updating even a single canvas each frame  :( <br><br>so, it's probably going to be limited in usefulness to things that don't need to draw to canvases often (like guis i guess)<br><br>but it did answer my original question: is it possible? yes. but is it practical? not really!<br><br>to quote myself:<blockquote class="uncited"><div>get better drivers/hardware dammit &gt;:(</div></blockquote><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1616">Xgoff</a> — Sat Aug 04, 2012 4:52 am</p><hr />
