Hi! Thanks for the kind note. <br><br>I see, thanks for elaborating on the SDL challenges. I suppose my point isn't as much "native landscape", but rather allow the love2d app to _render_ rotated, in landscape. Some games will render weird because the default canvas is portrait, and would work well if it thought it had the landscape orientation when initializing.<br><br>Just a thought.<br><br>Thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=270800">pjft</a> — Sat Mar 30, 2024 2:09 pm</p><hr />

Hi pjft,<br><br>I appreciate your feedback, and I am delighted to hear that this app is also helpful for you!<br><br>1) While it is technically feasible to launch a default program, my current concern lies in the potential issues that may arise with the program. For example, if an program crashes the tool, it could be challenging to handle... I am still figuring out how to effectively catch all errors thrown by Lua.<br><br>2) This feature will be included in the next version.<br><br>3) I agree that landscape mode would be beneficial for iPhone users. However, I have encountered some issues with unexpected behavior during orientation changes. Love2d is based on SDL, which operates differently from iOS's native UI frameworks. I have invested significant time in resolving this issue, but have not been successful yet. Once the problem is resolved, landscape mode will be enabled.<br><br>Thank you again for your support, and please stay tuned for updates.<br> <br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hi @marknote<br><br>First of all, thank you for putting this together! I just recently got into playing a bit with creating things on Lua, and indeed during the day I carry my tablet around but not my laptop, and it's easy to just troubleshoot things or make small adjustments as they come along. Thank you!<br><br>One of the things I am playing with is creating small apps for my kids, to also have them start feeling interested in Lua. They're using Scratch right now, but I want to start exposing them to a less visual programming language as well, and Lua seems to be a great next step.<br><br>This, then, leads me to three questions, as I install some of these apps on their tablets:<br>1) Is there a way to launch a default app when I open the studio? Right now it always opens the "No Game" screen, which I always have to close. It's almost as if it _is_ automatically launching something when it opens, but I can't figure out the expected path. I tried adding a main.lua file to the root, but the same happened. Can you allow for a default program to be launched when it opens? Say, if I create a folder named "Default" or something?<br>2) Is there a way to have the app run in complete full screen?<br>3) Last, I'd support the availability of the app on the iPhone if possible. I know that the experience isn't the same, but it's certainly doable for small tweaks. See the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visual-code/id6444809156?platform=iphone" class="postlink">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visual-co ... orm=iphone</a> Visual Studio Code app on the iPhone. We could code in portrait, and then run the apps in landscape. Right now they're stuck in portrait, which makes it hard to keep a consistent experience for the apps we're developing across desktop, tablet and phone. Any way to force the app to landscape?<br><br>Just a thought.<br><br>Thank you so much once again, and hope you have a great week!</div></blockquote><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=258095">marknote</a> — Sat Mar 30, 2024 11:57 am</p><hr />
