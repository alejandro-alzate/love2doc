Thank you for the kinda words and feedback! recovery is slow but steady, and I fully intend to keep powering through on this (albeit at a very relaxed pace until I'm better).<br><br>For more context on those map skills (hopefully I'm not repeating myself, I don't recall if I mentioned this here or not), they are intended as a simpler/more streamlined approach to Golden Sun's mechanic of casting spells out-of-combat to solve puzzles. I always loved the exploration and puzzle-solving aspects of those games, but didn't think that exact mechanic would fit as-is due to certain narrative and design aspects of the game... so instead I'm tying it to the characters themselves, and the kinds of abilities/knowledge/etc they might bring with them on the adventure. <br><br>That same mechanical 'theme' is also present in how the game's job system functions, but we'll get there later. Gotta keep some surprises for later after all!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 5:26 pm</p><hr />

I really hope you are able to continue work on this and that your health has improved. It looks fantastic so far! I especially like the idea of "Map Skills" as it makes the world more interesting and immersive. I grew up playing early "top down" console RPGs, so random combat is fine, (although I really like how Chrono Trigger had scripted "ambush" style encounters, because the player could avoid them if they just wanted to get on with the narrative, or 7th Saga, where you had a sort of "radar" crystal ball). As for saving...I'd suggest "autosave" as the player exits the game, and classic "save points" in "safe areas". Looking forward to future progress for this project, hang in there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=212438">zingo</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 9:18 am</p><hr />

Four months have passed since I last wrote about my work on this game. If you happen to read my blog regularly, <a href="https://www.huguesross.net/2022/11/i-hate-my-wrists.html" class="postlink">you already know why</a>. Development was on a health-based semi hiatus for that period, but I haven’t been doing nothing either. As the situation gradually improves, and development on the game progresses, it feels appropriate to finally discuss it again. Let’s see what I’ve done over the past few months!<br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Demo Progress</span><br>In my current state, art and level design are the most challenging things to do. Regardless, I was able to make a first pass on the vertical slice dungeon’s first floor:<div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="http://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=21846" class="postimage" alt="2022-12-09-untitled-rpg-devlog-5-1.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div>Before we continue I should note that this is basically a graybox design–it does not represent the final level’s aesthetics, only the general layout and mechanics. With that said, the mechanical aspect is complete! It’s possible to play it through from beginning to end, solving the dungeon’s introductory puzzles and finding loot (some of which is hidden for more observant players to find). There are still at least two more floors to assemble, possibly a third if the result feels too fast-paced.<br><br>Unfortunately, that’s most of the demo progress–as I mentioned above, most content creation was very difficult due my health so the rest of my work was more technical.<br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Controls</span><br>One of the things that was plaguing me from the start of the level design work was the lack of a run button. This was happening while I had my own health issues to consider, and it got me thinking about how best to reduce the need for holding keys down… naturally, this lead to a design similar to how games like Wild Arms and Mother 3 did it:<br><em class="text-italics">Push a button to start running, make directional inputs just to turn, and <strong class="text-strong">BONK</strong> comically into walls if you don’t turn away in time!</em><br><br>I think it’s a very good way to handle running for a few reasons:<ul><li> When it’s just “hold a button to move faster” you often wind up with an option to always have it on… which everyone picks, effectively just upping the base movement speed</li><li> Not only do you not have to hold the run button, you also don’t have to hold any movement inputs–on a straightaway it’s just fire and forget, which should help folks who have trouble holding movement inputs for long periods of time</li><li> By slowing the player down when they collide with things, this adds a skill curve to “going fast”. As players practice they can fly through tighter and tighter spaces without stopping, which in turn creates a rewarding sense of pride</li></ul>I also added some rudimentary gamepad support. It’s nothing stellar right now, just a rough stick-to-dpad conversion and button inputs, but it’s a start.<br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Encounters</span><br>Once the base level design was in place, I threw a little bit of love at random encounters. I already had a system for this in place, but I knew it needed more time in the oven. I don’t think old school random encounters are a particularly good mechanic for modern RPGs, but I have to rely on them for ‘budgetary’ reasons: The better alternatives are much more time and resource-heavy.<br><br>That doesn’t mean we have to handle them poorly, however. I’d already decided to keep encounters out of puzzle-dedicated areas, and took this a step further by adding some feedback on when encounters are present. To that end, there’s now a small ring at player’s feet indicating how close the next encounter is:<div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="http://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=21847" class="postimage" alt="2022-12-09-untitled-rpg-devlog-5-2.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div>I have another motive for this as well. You won’t see it anytime soon, but I plan to mess with this indicator as a way of building tension (or for bolder players, indicating “come get this!”) in areas where particularly dangerous monsters can appear. The graphic itself is a placeholder though, while I like the ring design conceptually it will need much more polish to meet my standards.<br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">How Do You Save Your Game?</span><br>Finally, now that the game has multiple maps it’s important to start thinking about how to track the long-term state of things:<ul><li> Is this chest open?</li><li> Which puzzles in this map have been solved? If they have multiple solved states, how do we know which they’re in?</li><li> Where is the player in the plot right now?</li></ul>I’ve started that process with simple persistence tracking, maps and their entities can mark certain properties to be saved and a central data store records their state when leaving (and of course, restores it when re-entering). It’s not a full save-load solution, but the data being tracked now will probably form the basis of that.<br><br>This also got me thinking about how saving works in RPGs. A lot of old games limited saving to specific areas for technical reasons, which often resulted in lost progress that modern players won’t tolerate. Most RPGs these days just let you save anywhere, but to be perfectly honest I have a big gripe with this: When watching people play RPGs, and when doing it myself, “Save Anywhere” frequently becomes “Save <em class="text-italics">Everywhere</em>”. It’s just one of those things people do, if you give them a button that lets them preserve their progress many will push it constantly, to the detriment of the game’s flow.<br><br>I decided to try and consider the real benefits of “Save Anywhere”, and I came up with three main benefits:<ol style="list-style-type:decimal"><li> You lose little to no progress on failure</li><li> It’s harder to accidentally lock yourself out of content when hitting a “point of no return”</li><li> You can leave whenever you want and pick up where you left off</li></ol>I like all of these points, and I think any alternative should preserve them. The first point should be filed with sufficiently robust auto save, although other solutions can exist (such as FFMQ’s ‘retry this fight’ button). Point #2 is probably better addressed in the game’s design, by trying not to lock the player out of content (and making it Very Obvious when you must), but point 3… that one’s tough.<br><br>I’m considering some kind of ‘save and quit’ or ‘suspend’-ish feature, where the game simply picks up from wherever you left, but I’m not sure how well players will take to this. I’m still thinking about it, and it will probably come down to later playtesting. In the end I may just give up and add a regular save button, but we’ll see.<br><br><br>So there we are! It’s not much progress for 4 months, but <em class="text-italics">it is progress</em> and that’s what matters right now. I also did a lot of thinking work, figuring out how to flesh out certain elements of the plot and setting, but it’s simply too early to talk about most of that. I don’t really want to delve into plot and setting detail publicly until I have more visuals to accompany that, and my health forbids it… For now I’m looking forward to an eventual recovery and some flashier stuff to show off, hopefully next year. We’ll see.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Fri Dec 09, 2022 8:18 pm</p><hr />

I'm back, and this time I have some good news! I've decided that the base engine is in a "good enough" state to start work on <em class="text-italics">real game content</em>, so I've begun the development of my vertical slice demo. As a reminder, my goal for this demo is to produce <strong class="text-strong">1 dungeon</strong> from the game at a close-to-final level of quality.<br><br>I'm still early in the production process, so I think I'll hold off another month before giving a deeper explanation. But I <em class="text-italics">can</em> show one of the dungeon's core mechanics: Water levels. Take a look!<br><br> <strong>iframe</strong> <br><br>By moving water between different basins, you'll be able to open and close off various paths. I think it's a pretty neat mechanic, though I'll have to be careful about giving the player a better sense of depth. This will probably come down to a combination of level design and giving floating objects a drop shadow to indicate their real position.<br><br>To make up for the lack of <em class="text-italics">detailed</em> dungeon talk today, here's one last treat. The first piece of concept art for this dungeon:<div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="http://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=21412" class="postimage" alt="07-31-small.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br>That little critter is one of several enemies you'll find in here. Keeping with the theme of water, most of the monsters in this dungeon are forms of marine life. We'll be seeing more of them as the demo's development progresses.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Sat Aug 06, 2022 1:08 pm</p><hr />

It's been about a month, so I think it's time for another update! Unfortunately I didn't get as much done as I wanted this month, because I developed carpal tunnel syndrome early on and went on hiatus for  few weeks in order to recover. I'm starting to feel better so development has resumed <em class="text-italics">at a <strong class="text-strong">very</strong> slow pace</em>, but obviously I didn't finish everything I was planning on. For now I'm just taking my time, better to work slowly for a while than to jump back in and have to stop entirely.<br><br>However, before all that happened I <strong class="text-strong">did</strong> get some things done. let's take a look!<br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">A Big AI Revamp</span><br>In the original demo video at this start of this thread, the enemies don't have <em class="text-italics">AI</em> so much as a list of moves that they randomly select from. That may be enough for a very simple encounters, but for boss fights and more complex enemies there needs to be something more complex. So, I added 3 new features to accommodate that:<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Behavior Trees</strong><br>The first thing I added was a simple behavior tree system. It supports a small set of useful patterns, like conditional branches and performing actions in sequence over the course of multiple turns. I don't want to load this post with too many details, so instead here are a few examples showcasing the kind of flexibility I have:<br><br><em class="text-italics">Attack pattern: Alternate between attacking and using a random special attack</em><div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>ai.sequence {    "fight.lua",    ai.shuffle {        "special_attack_1.lua",        "special_attack_2.lua",    },}</code></pre></div><em class="text-italics">Attack pattern: Perform special attacks in order, randomly interspersing the pattern with regular attacks</em><div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>ai.shuffle {    "fight.lua",    ai.sequence {        "special_attack_1.lua",        "special_attack_2.lua",    },}</code></pre></div><em class="text-italics">Attack pattern: Randomly select a regular or special attack. When health gets low, change to a different special attack</em><div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>ai.shuffle {    "fight.lua",    ai.condition (low_hp,        "special_attack_1.lua",        "special_attack_2.lua",    ),}</code></pre></div>This is a good start, but what if we want monsters to use attacks in response to what the player's doing?<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Reactions</strong><br>Reactions are special behavior trees that sit separate from the monster's main AI. These allow the monster to immediately respond when a hit with an attack or when the monster dies. It's not uncommon to have counters and revenge moves in turn-based games, so I felt it would be useful to make the system available to any actor in a fight. In theory this can also work for party members, though right now it's only being used for monsters.<br><br>Unlike regular moves, reactions are called immediately after the attack resolves and any attack that comes from them takes priority over anything that was already queued. They also only trigger if the original attack that caused them wasn't a reaction... mostly to avoid the possibility of two actors reacting to each other forever.<br><br>Anyway, these are nice but you don't usually want them all the time... Usually you want counters to come with characters changing their stance or form to indicate that attacking is a bad idea. This could be accomplished using status effects, but I elected not to do that because it could be a mess to manage. I also could've used the old-school RPG trick of replacing a character with a different one and copying over certain stats, but historically that trick has caused a lot of bugs in various games. So insteaaaad...<br><br><strong class="text-strong">States</strong><br>...I added states. States are very simple, they're basically a set of overrides for character properties like their appearance, stats, AI, etc. When a state change is triggered, the actor refreshes its properties and takes any values in the state over those in the base stat-block. That way, the monster stays the same and only replaces the values that need to change. It also means that if I add new features to monsters, states can automatically take advantage of them.<br><br>With all that in place, I'm able to produce some fairly complex interactions and strategies for the AI. Nothing on the level of what you'd need to mimic a human opponent, but enough to present interesting and unique challenges to the player. And that's exactly what I want!<br><br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">The New FX System</span><br>One more thing that I started prior to my health issues was an FX system for the game. I want to accomplish more than what simple pre-rendered effects can give me, so I set up a more concrete system with various forms of animation, tweens, and particle effects. In the long term I also want the ability to assign customs shaders to parts of effects and fullscreen post-processing as well, but I'm not there yet!<br><br>Right now I'm only using the initial version of the system for attacks attack animations in combat, but eventually I'll be using it on the map in cutscenes and pretty much anywhere I need it. I also want to add a way to integrate existing values and objects in a scene into FX to allow for things like a projectile that moves from one object to another, or a particle effect that accompanies a certain sprite animation. I also really need to make some kind of editor for these, as the animation data can get _really_ complex and verbose. But again, health issues... we'll get there eventually.<br><br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Putting it Together</span><br>To demonstrate of what I discussed above, here's a little video:<br> <strong>iframe</strong> <br><br>This is the same mimic fight from the first post, but with AI adjustments and combat effects. It plays out a little bit like a typical 1st boss of a Final Fantasy game--it sometimes closes its box, and counters with a powerful attack if disturbed. You can also see a status effect in this video, poison. I don't remember if I mentioned adding support for those in the past, but they exist.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2022 9:00 pm</p><hr />

May's just about over, so it's time for another update. Like April, this was another month of laying foundations. But <em class="text-italics">unlike</em> April, I have a little bit more to show this time.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Game Flow</strong><br>One slightly boring but <em class="text-italics">very important</em> addition is all of the scaffolding needed for the main menu. This includes letting the game track and adjust its state, which means that getting a 'game over' can actually take the user back to the menu to try again (or load a save, once I have those)... before then, losing would simply close the game!<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Sprites and better Movement</strong><br>A more interesting addition is sprite animations. I added a basic animation system that makes it very simple to animate existing elements in the game. It's not applied everywhere yet (there's no combat animations yet, for instance), but walking around is a lot nicer now that you can actually see characters walk. Even with placeholder sprites, it definitely adds something:<br> <strong>iframe</strong> <br><br>Another detail you may or may not have noticed, movement is a lot smoother than it was in my first demo. I reworked movement and collision a bit to allow some degree of sliding off solid surfaces instead of just stopping, and makes the controls feel a lot better!<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Cutscene Scripting</strong><br>One last important addition to the code is a system for cutscenes! This is definitely needed for an RPG like this, and the new system is pretty nice. By giving it a relatively simple script like this:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>context:show_dialogue("course/entry.lua")local player = context:get_player()context:fade_out(0.2):await(false)context:move_to(player, 1, 0, true)context:change_map("course.lua", 10, 29)local npc = context:get_actor("dude")context:fade_in(0.2):await(false)context:move_to(player, 0, -1, true)context:show_dialogue("course/welcome_sign.lua")context:move_to(npc, 1, 0, true)context:wait(0.20)context:turn_towards(npc, 180)</code></pre></div>...we get a cutscene:<br> <strong>iframe</strong> <br><br>That's all for this month! Things are really starting to come together on the tech side, I don't think it'll be too much longer before I can start on real game content instead of test data and placeholders.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Sun May 29, 2022 11:39 am</p><hr />

It has been about a month, so I figured it's about time for a small update. This past month has been pretty slow, mostly focused on filling in gaps in the worldbuilding and mechanics (ie. gear, status effects, encounter maps, etc). With that said, one new thing I <em class="text-italics">can</em> show off is the initial work on map skills.<br><br><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">What are map skills?</span><br>Map skills are tools you use to interact with the world. Each character that joins the party brings their own unique skill, opening new paths for exploration and puzzle-solving as the story progresses. While I've only just started on these, I have a very early video showing 3 map skills in an initial functioning state:<br> <strong>iframe</strong> <br><br>The three skills currently implemented are:<ul><li> <strong class="text-strong">Elemental</strong>, a context-sensitive interaction for casting elemental magic on certain parts of the environment.</li><li> <strong class="text-strong">Chain</strong>, allowing the player to grab movable objects and shift them as they move. This not only allows objects to be pulled, but also enables limited movement of objects across gaps.</li><li> <strong class="text-strong">Throw</strong>, for picking up, placing, and throwing lightweight objects.</li></ul><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Plans</span><br>Since this update's a little short, I figure I should give some indication of my long-term plans for the game. Currently, my target is a small vertical slice public demo. My hope for the demo is to ship a single dungeon from the game at close to final quality, in order to get a grip on the pipeline and validate the game's mechanics. My hope is to release this by the end of the year, though we'll see how it goes as things progress. Beyond that, I've currently broken the game up into 6 chapters and I'm hoping to release&amp;update the game chapter-by-chapter. But of course, that's a ways off. This is a marathon, not a sprint.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Fri May 06, 2022 1:07 am</p><hr />

Excellent work! I know how hard it can be to make that style of RPG...I mean, technically speaking you're not just making one game, you're making three or four. The battles are a different game, item management are, exploration is, etc. Very cool.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=125453">pauljessup</a> — Thu Mar 31, 2022 12:41 pm</p><hr />

This project is slowly starting to come together, so I figured I'd make a post for it. I've had an idea for a JRPG for a long time, and I finally decided to start this year! To showcase the last few months of programming work, I've put together a little demo video out of placeholders: <br><br> <strong>iframe</strong> <br><br>I also wrote <a href="https://www.huguesross.net/2022/03/untitled-rpg-its-alive" class="postlink">a blog post</a> about this demo, though I don't discuss much aside from some of the smoke &amp; mirrors involved currently  <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-wink.png" width="16" height="16" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br><br>Over time, I'm probably going to share screenshots / videos / demos directly in the thread, and use the blog for deeper dives into the design and writing process.<br><br>...I'll also see about cleaning up this post later, once there's more to the thread. But for now that's it, I'm just excited at the progress I've made.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Thu Mar 31, 2022 12:06 pm</p><hr />
