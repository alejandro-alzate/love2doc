So... I've just found this thread and this library, but I don't understand how to access data from an offline database file. I have a db with 2 tables and ~100 entries each (~3k entries in the future, these initial 100 are for testing purposes) and I need to know what should I write into the code, even for simples tests (like printing one of the records inside the .db file). the example given on github only shows how to create tables, but not how to read them. Could anyone help?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138384">PiFace</a> — Mon Sep 12, 2016 7:48 pm</p><hr />

Aren't you quite petulant yourself? Not accepting other opinions, deleting your post, laughing at others with memes, double posting.<br><br>I suggested not bundling both libraries (.so and .dll) in a single lua files since you never need both of them, I suggested using the builtin file options provided by [manual]io[/manual] and [wiki]love.filesystem[/wiki], I told you that a library that has the same size as LÖVE is somewhat big, I told you I didn't see much use on using databases in LÖVE (it may be useful in general Lua and specially OpenResty), I told you that most of the time people bundle dll and so files for distribution so making a library just for this may not be that useful.<br><br>None of this is non-constructive, it is negative, but I think you can use this well, improving your library so that it only boundles the dll or so file but not both, not sure how, using [manual]io[/manual] and [wiki]love.filesystem[/wiki] instead of base64 string, reducing the size of the library minimizing, gzipping or something (LÖVE provides [wiki]love.math.compress[/wiki]), you could post your library in other forums that target Lua in general and OpenResty, see how your library works with other platforms appart from LÖVE since this isn't probably your main market...<br><br>Also if you want people to be nice to you be nice to them, as I said the meme or whatever was unnecessary, I was pointing out that the library is heavy, it can not even be looked at in GitHub because of the size, it has the same size as LÖVE, I'm not short of HDD space, but I haven't seen libraries this heavy here in the forums, even games tend to be way smaller than that... That is the reason I pointed it out, plus this library will generate a new 2MB file in the user disk so it actually consumes 4MB...<br><br>Pointing out that double posting is bad is also constructive feedback, you MUST read the <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=64151" class="postlink">forum rules</a> before posting, so I was pointing it out<br><br>Well whatever if you think my criticism is bad or non-constructive is your problem, but you are damaging your reputation by deleting your post, you are destroying the little user base you may have for this library and you are being totally non-constructive with your attitude.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61024">Positive07</a> — Mon Aug 29, 2016 6:52 am</p><hr />

If you mean "<strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">criticism</em></strong>", it's a bit more complicated than that and I'd rather not go into it; however, your attitude is a good example of what I mean by negativity. Being a musician and an artist, I respond well to both negative and positive criticism so long as it's constructive. That being said. non-constructive criticism is of no use to me and even less so when it is presented in a petulant manner from a stance of nescience. I'll speak no more on the issue, think and say whatever else you please.<br><br>For anyone seeking updates, please refer to the github page.

All that's required of you, the programmer, is to provide a path to the script directory.<br><br>Note: If you're using LOVE (which you probably are since you're on the LOVE forums <img class="smilies" src="https://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-razz.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":P" title="Razz">), the path is already provided for you. So all you need to do is drop the plugin into your project and require it per the simple instructions on the Github.<br><br>How Do I Determine the Operating System That's Being Used?<br>You don't need to, the SQLite3 script does all that for you and selects the appropriate dll/so file to use for that OS.<br><br>Which Dll/so File Do I Use?<br>As stated above, SQLite3 takes care of making that determination so there's no need for you to have to sort through files trying to decide which one to use.<br><br>Do I Need to Move Dll/so Files?<br>Nope! This script will run SLQite3 from it's location. No need to move or copy anything.<br><br>I Thought External Libraries Had To Be In The LOVE Program Folder<br>By adding the correct path to the package.cpath variable, the SQLite3 script is able to use external libraries from any location.<br><br>Github Page (Download and Instructions)<br><a href="https://github.com/CentauriSoldier/SQLite3-for-Lua" class="postlink">https://github.com/CentauriSoldier/SQLite3-for-Lua</a><br><br>Test Results<br>Windows 32 bit: Untested<br>Windows 64 bit: Tested and Working<br>Linux 32 bit: Untested<br>Linux 64 bit: Tested and Working<br>Mac 32 bit: Untested<br>Mac 64 bit: Untested<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13156">Jack5500</a> — Fri Aug 26, 2016 1:58 pm</p><hr />

Don't double post, you can edit your posts, also it doesn't really solve the issue, 2MB of memory consumed by a string is not something I would want in my program, as I said there are better ways to ship a binary library, installers and zip packages are really common you know? Also this means that I would be shipping a dll and so files to each platforms instead of the specific library I need for that specific platform, I don't need so files in Windows and I don't need dllls in Linux or Mac OSX, also encoding in base64 means that each byte is stored in a byte and a half, taking 50% more space in the package... Really I don't think this method is nice, I prefere the raw dlls and so files<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61024">Positive07</a> — Mon Aug 22, 2016 12:09 am</p><hr />

Thanks for the feedback, Positive07. I see your point about the extra memory. Although I would venture to say that using less than 2mb of memory is trivial; however, due to the fact that such consumption seems to be a concern (and out of acknowledgement of good programming practices <img class="smilies" src="https://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-razz.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":P" title="Razz">), I will nullify the data after loading to prevent retention of unnecessary data.<br><br>Thanks for the tip <img class="smilies" src="https://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-glad.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50702">Centauri Soldier</a> — Sun Aug 21, 2016 11:07 pm</p><hr />

Saving a dll in a Lua string? Mmm sorry but I dislike the idea entirely, what's the problem with shipping dlls and so files as files? You wouldn't need to base64 encode nor decode it, you wouldn't have to load all those string into memory, you could load chunks as you copy them and discard them once they are not needed. Really I wouldn't use this, I prefere to make a zip file with the dll itself and make each user download the package for their system. Even then I don't see SQLite3 as being super useful for games being such a big dependecy anf databases not being commonly used for most games<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61024">Positive07</a> — Sun Aug 21, 2016 11:03 pm</p><hr />
