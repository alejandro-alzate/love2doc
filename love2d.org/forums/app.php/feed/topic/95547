- your title has "unicorn blood sacrfice" (not mad crawl)<br>- instructions on first screen is v helpful<br>- messages appear at the top AND the bottom. V confusing. Suggest you drop the one at the bottom and just fill the log at the top.<br>- graphics is awesome<br>- the 'confused' effect where keys become random is a great mechanic<br>- I can see friends and enemies through walls when I 'display' tags. Intentional?<br>- equipping things is a bit unintuitive. I got it after clicking around a bit.<br>- suggest the heart beat is turned off when health is 100%<br>- using a wand of flames requires no less than four mouse clicks. At least the 2nd click can be removed.<br>- i realised there was no line of sight with the wand until after I'd committed to an attack. I couldn't see a way to cancel the attack. (suggest right-click to cancel wand).<br>- I got stuck on some stairs and had to quit the game. That sames stairs worked on at least 3 previous occasions (I went up/down a few times) but then got stuck the 4th time. Screen shot for what it's worth.<br><br>I think the game is really engaging. Much more improved once I realised I had to follow my party.

I got an error, but the artwork and design is AWESOME! It is a little hard to understand what is going on. I know this is an alpha build mainly for testing, but if you're going to release it, then I think it should have instructions and make the more important text easier to see.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=274305">SuskyTheCorgi</a> — Sat Apr 06, 2024 10:56 pm</p><hr />
