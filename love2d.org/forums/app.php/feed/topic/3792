Hi Jeeper,<br><br><br>Thanks, I'll go and see ! The more games I see, the more chances I'll get to fully grok the engine and be able to do what I intend, which is a kind of EV-like. For now I'm still getting the feel of the simplest functions and marvelling at the simplicity of using LÖVE.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=139387">Mutos</a> — Sat Aug 05, 2017 12:14 pm</p><hr />

Cool game. I love it.<br><br>Here is one thing you might consider a bug: When I keep the mouse at a position and fly towards it and reach this point, the ship jumps back and forth. Maybe you want to disable movement when the ship is closer than one pixel to the cursor.<br><br>And here are some suggestions concerning the game design. These are just suggestions. If you disagree, feel free to ignore them.<br>- It might be easier to read the numbers on the right side, if you drew them all as a bar chart. Maybe you can find some pictograms for the different properties like "speed" and "fire rate" and then draw small bars below these pictograms. I believe small pictures are easier to perceive than numbers and text.<br>- The "health" is so important, that you might want to draw it right by the ship, similar to the health bar of the enemies.<br>- How about some limited time weapon power ups? For example a shotgun power up that makes the ship fire three bullets instead of one, but only for a limited time.<br>- As it is now, the game always ends when the player dies. That is straight forward, but in my opinion a bit disappointing. Maybe you can add some sort of level or wave system, so that the player gets some positive feedback and the feeling he has won something. It is also really rewarding if after a really hard wave there is a moment of rest before the next wave enters (also the player can collect all the power ups in that time).<br>- I'd very much appreciate a high score table in the end, when I die.<br><br>Don't understand that as negative feedback. The game is addictive as it is.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=67839">micha</a> — Thu Jan 03, 2013 11:33 am</p><hr />

Yah, don't be concerned by the lack of feedback. I believe that adding the multi-weapon and instead of have limited play arena if you keep our ship in the middle screen and put off-screen ships (or planets and other stuff) keep pumping up in our area you basically have a "full" engine to do more ambitious projects of this kind. You already done a lot of good features. With a more clever ship IQ of flying around us instead of suicide attacks probably you have all basics that a major spaceship game needs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3988">coffee</a> — Thu Nov 03, 2011 7:41 am</p><hr />
