He he, isometric Minecraft would be amusing.<br><br>I know the shadow thing you're talking about, redlock. I decided to trade-off the ability to properly depth-sort objects with graphics that go below (on the screen, not 3D) their origins to gain a significant performance increase. The fastest way to fix it is to change two lines in Isome\engine\engine.lua to these:<br><br>line 209: lgdraw(v.si, math.round(rx-cam.x), math.round(ry-cam.y)-6, 0, 1,1, 8,4)<br>line 214: lgdraw(v.i, math.round(rx-cam.x), (ry-cam.y)-6, 0, 1,1, 16,32)<br><br>Note the new -6 on the y-coordinates - that moves the graphic upwards a bit, so they won't be clipped by the next row in the depth sort. However, that can make precision jumping a little bit harder. *Shrugs*<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=874">Taehl</a> — Sun Dec 12, 2010 9:40 pm</p><hr />

zac352, save files are in, at the moment, pure Lua code. Back in Love 0.60 I used to zip them (which really helped), however, newer versions of Love somehow broke the file-reading in just such a way that my zipper won't work any more. *Sigh*<br><br>It works just fine in Love 0.7.
