Thank you Hydrogen Maniac.

I replaced the fov value math.pi/2 to math.rad(60) and it looks better.<br>2) Also in init.lua calling love.graphics.setMeshCullMode("back") would be great, because normally you do not want to draw back faces for polygons to speed things up.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=178662">Rigachupe</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 4:55 pm</p><hr />
