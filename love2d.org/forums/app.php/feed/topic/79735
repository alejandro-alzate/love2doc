Good job on finishing what you have so far. The collisions are particularly precise. I don't think diagonal movement is a MUST. But I don't think it would look awkward with the current animations either. Your call. Also, you have my sympathy w.r.t. engineering school. I just graduated in May.

When doing diagonal with only 4 sprite directions simply prefer the direction you pressed first. Or just use left and right when one of them is held at the same time as up or down.<br><br>You have to have diagonal if the game is free-roaming. Otherwise it feels clunky. It's really hard to play the original Zelda because of this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=594">Jasoco</a> — Thu Feb 26, 2015 10:45 am</p><hr />

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yeah, I thought of arrow keys directly after releasing it. Diagonal movement is kinda meh - it doesn't look good without specific art for it, and these walk cycles are already 12 frames per direction.</div></blockquote>The animation was the reason I eventually decided to use 3d-models on my game (and moved on to use 3d game engine), although I could have pre-rendered stuff in blender to 2d-images then use them, but I figured might as well go full 3d if using 3d-stuff, instead of pseudo 3d. I thought that if I can make one character per day, I then can create endless amount of animations by just moving bones, unlike drawing stuff unless its sideways. I figured in the end I might save the time compared to drawing stuff. Although I am not sure if this is true, since I horirbly lack in artistic skills.<br><br>The game looks promising.

It's called Us and Them and it's a singleplayer story-based RPG. It looks and plays a bit like Final Fantasy, but it'll feature a few very unique things that should set it apart. For now, I'm using Kenney's RPG pack, but I'll eventually modify it and expand upon it for unique content - keeping the look though!<br><br>So far, I've finished teleporting between maps, character movement and collision, map and entity loading, and a day/night cycle. I'm releasing it now to see if anyone else can break something! It's not a completed game by any means.<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Changelog:</strong><br>Release 2:<ul><li>Added diagonal movement</li><li>Enabled arrow keys for movement</li></ul>Release 1:<ul><li>Initial release</li></ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=103656">Kyle</a> — Thu Feb 26, 2015 1:18 am</p><hr />
