Wow. Bumping because this works 'out of the box' despite being old code and a dead thread.

I just downloaded the gamera demo, and ran into some issues running it with Love 11.0; the background was entirely white rather than being tiled, and the blue box was opaque. It took me a while to figure it out, but the problem was caused by the new color system being from 1 to 0 rather than 225 to 0. I switched the values in setColor to fit the new system, and everything was fine.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=140048">lazershark3k</a> — Tue Apr 10, 2018 5:00 pm</p><hr />

Hi there,<br><br>That is not a strictly gamera-related issue. It happens frequently with any LÖVE game which tries to use quads to show tiles.<br><br>The dt variable which LÖVE uses for time, however, is *very* floating-point in nature, like 0.1274232. Which when you multiply by the scrolling velocity of your game, gives you coordinates like x=345.183523. If draw on integer-based coordinates (x=345 or x=346) you won't see those "seams". But given the way dt works in LÖVE, that is rarely an option (you chould "floor" the coordinates of your tiles before drawing them, but that would make scrolling and movement less fluid). It's when you draw in non-integer coordinates when the seams appear. The reason are complicated to explain here.<br><br>A "correct" solution to this problem would be rendering all the tiles into a big canvas, using integer-based coordinates, and then draw the canvas with a float offset. This is rarely an option, because the canvas for a complete level can be quite big, and if you split the level into smaller canvases you will still get "seams" in the separation between canvases.<br><br>Another option that you can try is "expanding the borders of your tiles a couple pixels" in your original image. This means that if you have 32x32 tiles, instead of making them 32x32 in your image, you make them 36x36: The 32x32 tile is in the middle, and the 2-pixel border around it is "padding", colored the same way as the internal 32x32 tile (if a tile is brown on the left, its left "border" will be brown. If the tile is gray on the right, its right "border" will be gray). The seams will still appear, but since they will (hopefully - this depends on how OpenGL is implemented on each machine) be of the same color of the tile, it won't be noticeable.<br><br>I don't use STI, but this problem is so common that it's possible that they already have one or two ways of dealing with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=710">kikito</a> — Tue Apr 11, 2017 9:34 pm</p><hr />

Hey! So I'm using STI to load my maps made in Tiled and I just include it's draw function in gamera's draw function. It looks something like this<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>function World:update(dt)    -- Update every layer in the map level    self.level:update(dt)    playercam:setPosition(self.level.layers.entities.player.x, self.level.layers.entities.player.y)end</code></pre></div>with playercam being my instance of gamera.<br><br>Now when I end up launching it looks like the screenshot posted when I first start, then I move and those artifacts dissapear, but then once I start moving around a bit those artifacts will appear again then immediately disappear at seemingly random intervals. Just curious do you know what may be causing this or is there any more info I could provide to try to understand what's going on? Thanks for looking at this I appreciate it!<dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><a href="https://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=14968&amp;mode=view"><img src="https://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=14968" class="postimage" alt="camerissues.PNG" /></a></dt></dl><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=139011">Saphiresurf</a> — Sun Apr 09, 2017 12:43 am</p><hr />

I attempted to switch my game from hump camera to gamera. For some reason, this caused pink outlines around most of my actor/item tiles... (I've tried changing the filter and note this doesn't happen with hump camera and I'm not scaling or rotating) Also it's possible to walk out of the visible window. I've verified that the updateCamera function is being called (with the proper coords), so why the camera doesn't center on the player?<br><br>Also half-tiles sometimes appear even though I've set my window size parameters to 0,0, 640, 640. 640 being a multiple of 32 shouldn't cause any non-full tiles to be drawn??<br><br>Any help?<dl class="file"><dt><img src="./images/upload_icons/love.png" alt="" /> <a class="postlink" href="https://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=13948">gamera.love</a></dt></dl><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138380">Zireael</a> — Wed Oct 19, 2016 12:23 pm</p><hr />

How do I draw the map so that I can use gamera with my game?</div></blockquote>That post is about optimization. Let me try to explain.<br><br>Gamera (and hump.camera, as far as I know) assume that your level "doesn't move" in order to make scroll work; There is a constant system of reference which is independent of the camera - this is called "world coordinates" in gamera. These world coordinates are usually in pixels. On this system, the top-left corner of the tile on row 1, column 1 is usually at 0,0. If the tiles are 32x32, then the corner of tile to the left is at 32,0. And so on. The important thing is that, unless these tiles are moving platforms or something like that, these coordinates never change - even if they "seem to move to the right" when the camera moves to the left. No one is doing "tile.x = tile.x + speed * dt".<br><br>Instead, the camera moves its position, and then makes transformations to the graphics pipeline before things are drawn. If the camera has moved 100 pixels to the right, the tiles will look as if they have moved 100 pixels to the left (even if they have not moved at all). This way, the camera can be thought of as a rectangle which moves around in the world.<br><br>The demo on the first post illustrates this. The world gray tiles never move, even when the cameras move, following the player. It's just that gamera does clever transformations before drawing the rectangles (before entering each camera's :draw method). The "blue rectangle" visible in the demo represents "the part of the world that cam1 can see". It is a rectangle in the "world coordinates".<br><br>This means that <strong class="text-strong">you could draw the whole world on each frame</strong>. If you make a draw call for every tile and every object on the level inside cam:draw, it will work - but that will be very inefficient (usually, most of the tiles and most levels are not visible, so there would be lots of unnecessary draw calls).<br><br>That's what those 4 parameters in camera:draw are for. They give you a "rectangle" in your world coordinates representing the screen (or a rectangle encompassing that, if you are using rotation). You don't need to draw anything outside that rectangle, because it would fall out of the screen anyway. How you reduce the draw calls to accomodate this depends on how you represent stuff in your game. The post you mention explains how to do this "trimming" on tile-based games (I think it applies to yours). It's an ideal scenario because it is relatively easy because changing from "draw all the world" to "draw only a rectangle of the world" is easy.<br><br>EDIT: I have attached a modified demo file. On this one, both cameras (cam1 and cam2) draw the same rectangles (the ones visible for cam1). Hopefully this will help you understand how the optimization works - cam1:getVisible() returns a rectangle which can be used to limit the tiles.<dl class="file"><dt><img src="./images/upload_icons/love.png" alt="" /> <a class="postlink" href="https://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=13949">gamera-demo-optimization.love</a></dt></dl><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=710">kikito</a> — Wed Oct 19, 2016 11:15 am</p><hr />

@endlesstravel: There are several things wrong with your code. Let me explain:<br><ul><li>You are "reusing" the same camera (the variable called <strong class="text-strong">cam</strong>) to display two viewports. That is not a good idea. Instead, use two cameras, one called <strong class="text-strong">cam1</strong> and another called <strong class="text-strong">cam2</strong> (or <strong class="text-strong">camLeft</strong> and <strong class="text-strong">camRight</strong>). One will be used for the left "window" and the other for the right "window" (these are called "viewports" in gamera).</li><li>It seems you don't understand what the "world" is in gamera: The world is your "how many pixels does your whole level have" (with a 1:1 scale). I think in your case it is (0, 0, 1800, 800). And it should be that for both cameras, since they are on the same world. You don't need to "set it up" on every frame, just use that instead of (0,0,800,600) when creating the cameras.</li><li>Since your game world does not change in size while you play with it, you don't need to "reset" the world on every frame - you can leave it "fixed" when you create both cameras.</li> <li>The same happens with the viewport and the scale. Since they don't change, you can set them once right after create the cameras. There is no need to do it on every frame.</li> </ul><br>@meowman9000:<br><br>Your life would be much easier if your tiles were organized in a two-dimensional table, instead of using a monodimensional one. I have an article which explains both of them here: <a href="https://github.com/kikito/love-tile-tutorial/wiki/0b-tables" class="postlink">https://github.com/kikito/love-tile-tut ... /0b-tables</a><br><br>There are several things on this line:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>love.graphics.draw(tileset, Quads[mymap.layers[1].data[wholeMap[visibleItems[i]][1]]],wholeMap[visibleItems[i]][2],wholeMap[visibleItems[i]][3])</code></pre></div><ul><li>First, you could make it easier to read (and also faster) if you used local variables for the repeated parts. <strong class="text-strong">wholeMap[visibleItems<em class="text-italics"></em></strong><em class="text-italics">, is a good candidate.<br></em></li><li><em class="text-italics">Second, your drawing function is called <strong class="text-strong"> levelUpdate</strong>. Yet it doesn't update anything. That's quite misleading. It also has a comment right before it which says "draw map". I strongly suggest you rename it to <strong class="text-strong">drawMap</strong> and remove that comment.<br></em></li><li><em class="text-italics">Third, the name bumpworldRef is very inconsistent. The uppercase/lowercase rule is broken (it should be <strong class="text-strong">bumpWorldRef</strong>, not <strong class="text-strong">bumpworldRef</strong>), and also you don't use "Ref" for other tables in your code, so you might as well remove that part, and leave it in <strong class="text-strong">bumpWorld</strong>.<br></em></li><li><em class="text-italics">Last, using "magical numbers" like [1], [2] and [3] makes the code less clear. If you can, organize your tables so that you use names instead - like "quadName", "x" and "y". The drawing code would look like this:</em></li></ul><em class="text-italics"><br><br></em><div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><pre><code>function drawLevel(bumpWorld)   local visibleItems, len = bumpWorld:queryRect(0,0,800,600)   for i=1, len do     local tile = wholeMap[visibleItems[i]]     local quad = Quads[mymap.layers[1].data[tile.quadName]]     love.graphics.draw(tileset, quad, tile.x, tile.y)   end end</code></pre></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=710">kikito</a> — Sat Apr 02, 2016 2:27 pm</p><hr />
