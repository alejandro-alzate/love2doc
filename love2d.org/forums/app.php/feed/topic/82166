I don't think I can help you more than that. If it's still not working, it must be a problem from the repository and there's not much I can do to help you with that.<br><br>On a side note, I encorage people to start using the new <a href="https://www.love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=84226" class="postlink">AdMob repo by bio1712</a> since it's more up to date with the changes to the official LÖVE's android repository and has reward videos supported.
