To be fair, you could just use a different format that does support sound samples, like the tracker modules löve supports (mod,s3m,xm,it - midi can be converted to these relatively simply by using modplug tracker or whatever else on OSes other than windows).<br><br>...that said, i really feel like i should hurry up and make that midi parsing library and softsynth so people can just play around with midi files in löve.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80325">zorg</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 7:03 pm</p><hr />

Thank you for the kinda words and feedback! recovery is slow but steady, and I fully intend to keep powering through on this (albeit at a very relaxed pace until I'm better).<br><br>For more context on those map skills (hopefully I'm not repeating myself, I don't recall if I mentioned this here or not), they are intended as a simpler/more streamlined approach to Golden Sun's mechanic of casting spells out-of-combat to solve puzzles. I always loved the exploration and puzzle-solving aspects of those games, but didn't think that exact mechanic would fit as-is due to certain narrative and design aspects of the game... so instead I'm tying it to the characters themselves, and the kinds of abilities/knowledge/etc they might bring with them on the adventure. <br><br>That same mechanical 'theme' is also present in how the game's job system functions, but we'll get there later. Gotta keep some surprises for later after all!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=183383">Hugues Ross</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 5:26 pm</p><hr />

Hello!<br><br>I was looking through the internet about how to use soundfonts (in .sf2 format) to play MIDI files, what can greatly reduce the size of the project and add a special charm to the game since it doesn't need to rely on the OS soundbank (that in case of Windows is very terrible).<br><br>I don't know if Löve natively supports it, but i saw in the wiki something about loading C/C++ libraries (or .dll/.so) and looking through Github i saw two libraries for that: <a href="https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont" class="postlink">TinySoundFont</a>, that is pretty raw since the dev need to implement all the .mid loading to pass each note through the library to be processed, if i'm not mistaken, and <a href="https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth" class="postlink">FluidSynth</a>, i already knew about this library since mkxp used it internally, seems to be more easy to play midis through it.<br><br>I don't have much knowledge about working with C/C++ libraries or interacting with DLL/SOs, so does anybody here tried to work with libs like these to play mids in a pretty way using Löve?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=139626">vico</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 3:37 pm</p><hr />

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...</div></blockquote>&gt; Could it be that Löve is not the best choice of langage for what I'm trying to do?<br>People might say it's geared towards games, and that's not wrong, but it's still possible to do most things with it... i mean, others have also made tools with it, some made soft synths as well; i'm also working on some stuff, including a more or less complete composing software, so it's definitely possible.<br><br>&gt; That's where I'm hoping Peter Billam's set of MIDI lua libraries might come in handy<br>It could be a possibility, although the one i saw on that page does offline conversion, not realtime... it might still be fine for your use case though, if it can be either used through löve, or called as an external application.<br><br>&gt; later in your reply, you said you "tried to" write one? You gave up?<br>I put it on hold, since i couldn't figure out why it was parsing some things wrong... not a good idea for me to suffer through that kind of annoyance for too long.<br><br>&gt;That sounds like a nice idea <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-smile.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":)" title="Smile"> How far along are you? A soft synth is what turns the midi info into audio, right? Are you going to write your own?<br>As i mentioned before, the midi file parser is on hold for now; and for synths, i have too many projects and random files with stuff i want to implement, it's hard to combine all of that into one thing. But yes, i'm writing my own things, with info from elsewhere of course; different synthesis types and waveforms and effects and whatnot.<br>Also, technically speaking, a synth just turns whatever data it supports, be it midi or otherwise, and makes audio from it, either to your speakers, or writing it directly to disk.<br><br>&gt;Hmmm... simply outputing a frequency will result in audio that won't sound very musical, will it?<br>You'll still hear the correct pitches, but yes, if everything is just a sine wave, it'll get annoying real fast; that's actually the problem with Löve's own handling of midi, if you don't have timidity... and i'd wager most people don't, hence one of my goals being to create a lua-side parser and synth (and sampler) library that could work cross-platform to play back midi with consistent instruments... at least if using the default General Midi ones. (although at that point, i could make my own format that combines the midi file with some instrument definitions as well, to make it more versatile, and still be portable... this probably already exists though, people just don't know/forgot about it, like pat files or such; most of this was DOS and Amiga era stuff anyway, which is considered ancient.)<br><br>&gt; And down the line, I'm hoping to add some chord recognition, that will take polyphonic support...<br>Technically, i should have said that i expected your input midi files to only use one channel / one instrument; polyphony within those constraints is possible and still relatively simple considering the program you want to write as a test.<br><br>&gt; Again that sounds like trying hard not to use an existing synth? Why would I want to do that?<br>Because none exists as far as i know, in the context of Löve applications / libraries... that said, i do recall 1 or 2, but i'm not sure if the people did write them with löve, or if they moved to something else. In any case, this one is really simple, and i'd recommend to do this. <em class="text-italics">(re: A simpler way to play sounds would be to have one sound file of one instrument, say a piano note or a guitar string being strung, then you could load that into löve and play it back with whatever pitch it needs to be.)</em><br><br>&gt; So if I understand you correctly, any virtual MIDI synth will handle those instruments (using a soundfont or not) and I don't really need to worry about using the soundfont, the synth will handle it if it needs it?<br>Nope, depends on the synth what sound it produces and whether it cares about midi instruments or not; even using a soundfont doesn't guarantee it'll have all sounds that the GM (general midi) standard defines... and even if it did, the quality can and will differ... you can check out some youtube vids that play the OST of transport tycoon deluxe through multiple midi-compatible devices to hear the difference (and yes, they all play back the same midi files)<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSEfKAYyNo" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSEfKAYyNo</a> using Windows GeneralMidi sounds.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTi6LG8aeK8" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTi6LG8aeK8</a> using the AdLib sound card (has a yamaha chip, midi instruments are purely synthesized)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol6Wv4bn2Lc" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol6Wv4bn2Lc</a> using the Gravis Ultrasound sound card (it plays back samples, sounding subjectively better)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2n1tIaMy5E" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2n1tIaMy5E</a> using a roland MT-32 hardware unit (hybrid synth+sampler, not GM compliant, instruments will sound different)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJu8u3QOmk" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJu8u3QOmk</a> using a roland SC-88 hardware unit (hybrid synth+sampler, but people mostly used the high-quality samples instead of the cut-down synthesizer it had)<br><br>&gt; I'm curious, why did you choose not to use MIDI then?<br>A few reasons; midi is more limited in terms of how much control you have over the individual voices compared to a tracker module; also, the format was simpler to implement compared to midi, and it also comes with its own sound files, meaning less work since i didn't need to write a synth for that. <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-three.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":3" title="Awww"><br><br><br>...btw, if it was up to me, i'd not use anything related to web or whatever that would need a browser to run, that feels cheap to me and i'm averse to have whatever browser i have running for a local tool...  <img class="smilies" src="http://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-surprised2.png" width="16" height="16" alt=":o:" title="Oh"><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80325">zorg</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2023 3:32 pm</p><hr />
