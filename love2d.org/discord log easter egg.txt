How i get in private contact with an admin? just i want to ask something can be a new channel or something i really don't need dm access, but i don't wanna spill the beans about something

14:01 Sasha:
if it's about this discord server or love's source code you can message me, if it's about the website there's a contact button in the forum i think

14:01 alejandroalzatesanchez:
about the site but not related to the forum

14:01 Sasha:
also there's a separate email button on the home page, either should work i think

14:02 alejandroalzatesanchez:
i mean is not a issue or something

14:02 zorg:
is it security related? or is it just "why no new löve games on the homepage"

14:03 alejandroalzatesanchez:
neither security related it just a thing that is harmless but i don't think you want me to spoil the fun for everyone

14:03 Sasha:
is it the konami code

14:03 josh:
im so curious

14:03 zorg:
pretty sure people know about that

┌ @Sasha is it the konami code
14:03 alejandroalzatesanchez:
yup

14:03 josh:
oh ok

14:03 zorg:
yes it plays haddaway's song

┌ @zorg pretty sure people know about that
14:04 alejandroalzatesanchez:
josh seems clueless from the looks of it

14:04 zorg:
well, when you're being so vague about things :P
that said, i know another one

┌ @zorg yes it plays haddaway's song
14:04 alejandroalzatesanchez:
Who was it, i discovered just because i found the script way too sus

14:05 zorg:
if you mean the artist, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXWRTEbj1I
if you mean who coded the easter egg, i don't exactly know 

┌ @zorg well, when you're being so vague about things :P that said, i know another one
14:05 alejandroalzatesanchez:
I mean is an easter egg i didn't wanted to spoil it

┌ @zorg if you mean the artist, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXWRTEbj1I if you mean who coded the easter egg, i don't exactly know
14:05 alejandroalzatesanchez:
who hid the code

14:06 alejandroalzatesanchez:
well done tbh

14:06 zorg:
there's also that thing that happens when you do #germanunkol after the website link

14:06 Clem:
time to pen-test the love site and find all the secrets

14:06 Clem:
if it goes down tonight I may have messed up fuzzing I'm sorry (I'm kidding) 

┌ @zorg there's also that thing that happens when you do #germanunkol after the website link 
14:07 alejandroalzatesanchez:
Oh pretty!

┌ @Clem time to pen-test the love site and find all the secrets
14:07 alejandroalzatesanchez:
lmaoooo

┌ @Sasha is it the konami code
14:07 alejandroalzatesanchez:
again i found just because i was poking the files

14:07 Clem:
I'm studying it atm and it would be a nice low-stakes target but I'm scared I'll mess something up

14:09 alejandroalzatesanchez:
that vagueness and saying that wasn't nothing of the above sold me did they?

14:10 zorg:
i was really curious what would warrant creating a channel on discord though

14:11 Clem:
I at first though he was trying to phish admins or maybe he found a security leak but it was nice and innocent 

14:11 Clem:
maybe there is a love2d ARG coming

14:11 Clem:
the engine was the game all along

┌ @Clem I at first though he was trying to phish admins or maybe he found a security leak but it was nice and innocent
14:12 alejandroalzatesanchez:
that's suspicion is fair, and i was trying to send a link with a yt video (this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRz3Eh_5ZOg)
"I found an easter egg on love2d.org"

14:13 alejandroalzatesanchez:
I really felt like the guy that found a fricking bacdoor on XZ for a short moment

14:13 Clem:
it's in the html but encoded https://love2d.org/egg.js

14:15 alejandroalzatesanchez:
i deobfuscated it with the help of the legally distinct green box with white fan blades

14:15 Clem:
a tru hacker

14:15 alejandroalzatesanchez:
lmaooo
